**Project Title**

#### Data Science Projects with Titanic, Iris, and MovieLens Datasets

## **Project Description**
This repository contains a collection of data science projects that utilize three popular datasets: Titanic Solution, Iris Flower, and MovieLens. Each project addresses unique data analysis and modeling tasks.

## **Titanic Solution Dataset:**
Analyze the Titanic passenger dataset to predict survival outcomes using various machine learning models

## **Iris Flower Dataset:**
Perform classification and clustering on the Iris dataset to identify different species of iris flowers based on their features.

## **MovieLens Dataset:**
Create recommendation systems for movie ratings using the MovieLens dataset.
